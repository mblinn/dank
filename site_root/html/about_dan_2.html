                    <p>Certainly, Dan was not a passive individual who let life pass him by unnoticed. On any given weekend Dan would be off drag racing his Camaro at Lebanon Valley; water skiing with family and friends in Lake George; hosting parties in the family’s “man-lodge” (in name only) over the garage; or just driving around helping those in need.</p>
                    
          <p>Dan was also a physical fitness enthusiast who exercised with as much passion as he lived life. As a regular at Gold’s Gym Dan had a regimen that put people half his age to shame, and always encouraged everyone around him to reach his or her full individual potential. “Life is brief, and time’s a thief”, Dan would often say to his kids and others.</p>

          <p>For sure, that’s true Dan, because time took you away from us far too soon. We know, however, that time never got the better of you—there were no wasted moments or idle days. We can honor your memory, but more importantly we can learn from your life. Thanks, Dan.
          And by the way, who has it better than us, huh?</p>
