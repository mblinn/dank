          <p>Dan was a lifelong resident of the Carmel area. After attending Mahopac High School and serving honorably as a Navy rescue diver during the Vietnam War, Dan “settled down” (so to speak—see below), with his wife Sandy and their two children, Danny and Erin, to become one of the most beloved individuals ever known in this little Hamlet.</p>
          
          <p>Anybody who met Dan once instantly became his best friend, enjoying Dan’s passion for life, childlike sense of humor and heart of gold. Whether during a chance meeting on the street, an organized celebration or a friendly dinner, Dan would always remind his company how good life was by pulling them aside and saying, “Hey, who has it better than us, huh?”</p>
